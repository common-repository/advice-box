Shortcodes for info and advice boxes.

== Description ==

Small collection of shortcodes for displaying advice boxes.

This is only a plugin which enables shortcodes for advice boxes. 

*[advice_box type="positive"]YOUR TEXT[/advice_box]* - calls a green advice box
*[advice_box type="negative"]YOUR TEXT[/advice_box]* - calls a red advice box
*[advice_box type="info"]YOUR TEXT[/advice_box]* - calls a grey advice box

For adding a close button you can use this shortcode:
*[advice_box type="info" close="true"]YOUR TEXT[/advice_box]* - calls a grey advice box with a close button, which removes the adive box from DOM.
